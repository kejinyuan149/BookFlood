#Introduction

This is my implementation to Stanford's CS140 Pintos Project. Pintos is a simple operating system framework for the 80x86 architecture. It supports kernel threads, loading and running user programs, and a file system,but it implements all of these in a very simple way.

#Feature List

* Avoid alarm clock's busy waiting.
* Priority Scheduling Support.
* A multilevel feedback queue scheduler similar to the 4.4BSD scheduler.
* Implement argument passing to user program.
* Basic system call framework.
* Lazy loading of a user program.
* Stack growth support.
* Implement memory mapped files system call.

#TODO

* Fix the bugs of virtual memory implement.
* Strengthen the file system implementation.
* Socket API implementation.
* Support multi-core processors.
